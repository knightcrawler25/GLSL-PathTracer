Features
--------
- Unidirectional path tracer
- RadeonRays for building BVHs (Traversal is performed in a shader)
- Disney BSDF
- Texture Mapping (Albedo, Metallic-Roughness, Normal)
- Spherical and Rectangular Area Lights
- IBL with importance sampling
- Progressive + Tiled Rendering (Reduces GPU usage and timeout when depth/scene complexity is high)

Build Instructions
--------
Please see INSTALL-WIN.txt for the build instructions for Windows and INSTALL-LINUX.txt for Linux
